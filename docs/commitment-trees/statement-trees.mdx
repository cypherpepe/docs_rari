# Statement trees

Statement Trees (ST) accommodate basic statements without hierarchical relations and time bounds. They are further subdivided into arbitrary and adjustable.

## Arbitrary Statement Trees (ARST)

This subtype imposes no validation rules on the data added. It acts as an open outlet where any commitment can be submitted and later revealed alongside its validation rules, like a permissionless wall where anyone can write what they want.

## Adjustable Statement Trees (ADST)

This subtype allows setting rules for adding commitments to the tree. To add commitment to the ADST tree, the user must prove that the statement satisfies the rules (partial knowledge).
