# Core API

Our API provides a programmatic helper for working with the Rarimo Protocol.
Using the API, you can fetch the supported blockchains, contract addresses, tokens that can be natively used with Rarimo.
It is structured to support a discovery process to build one-off developer scripts or dynamic user-generated flows.

:::note

You can work with our API with NO authentication. Its free to use, today and forever.
