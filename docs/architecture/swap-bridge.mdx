# Swapping and bridging

_Swapping_ is the process of exchanging one token for another on the same chain.

_Bridging_ is the process of moving tokens from one chain to another.
However, technically, Rarimo does not transfer the tokens themselves; instead, it locks tokens on the source chain and unlocks equivalent tokens on the destination chain.

For examples of tokens that you can swap and bridge, see [Moving liquidity across chains](../reference/contracts/guides/moving-liquidity).

## Swapping limitations

Rarimo can swap ERC-20 tokens to native tokens and native tokens to ERC-20 tokens on the same chain.

To swap tokens, Rarimo uses these decentralized exchanges (DEXs):

- Uniswap
- Pancakeswap
- Quickswap
- Trader Joe

Therefore, Rarimo is limited by the swaps that these DEXs can do.

## Bridging

Rarimo bridges tokens via USDC tokens:

1. It swaps the source tokens to USDC on the source chain.
1. It locks the USDC on the source chain.
1. It unlocks USDC on the destination chain.
1. It swaps the USDC for the desired token on the destination chain.

For example, this diagram shows the process of converting ETH on Ethereum to AVAX on Avalanche by using USDC to bridge the tokens:
