# ZK Reputation

## What is ZK Reputation?

ZK Reputation allows users to prove their social standing without compromising privacy.

## Why ZK Reputation?

Traditional reputation systems often require users to expose personal data or interactions to verify credibility. ZK Reputation solves this by letting users demonstrate trustworthiness without revealing sensitive information. This approach benefits social and professional platforms where privacy is essential, from decentralized marketplaces to community-driven DAOs.

## How does it work?

ZK Reputation uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify user actions stored in a permissionless registry. Users can selectively disclose verified elements of their social reputation while the specifics of each action remain hidden. This process enables a high degree of privacy, as only the proof, not the underlying actions, is revealed.

## Use cases

- **Decentralized Marketplaces**: Prove trustworthiness as a buyer or seller without revealing complete transaction histories.
- **Social Platforms**: Demonstrate social standing or contributions without exposing individual interactions.
- **DAOs and Governance**: Verify participation and influence in community activities while keeping voting records private.
- **On-chain Games**: Prove your character's level without doxxing your wallet.

## Can I use it now?

ZK Reputation is under development and is currently seeking early adopters. Please get in touch with us on [X](https://x.com/Rarimo_protocol).
