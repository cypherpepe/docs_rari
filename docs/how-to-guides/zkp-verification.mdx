# Verifying Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Smart Contracts

The following guide will instruct you on integrating zero-knowledge proofs into an existing smart contract written in Solidity.

Let's assume we have a generic ERC-20 contract based on <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenZeppelin implementation</a>):

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

contract ERC20 is IERC20 {
    // ...skipping the ERC20 boilerplate...

    // We want to add the proof verification here
    function mint(uint amount) external {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;
        totalSupply += amount;
        emit Transfer(address(0), msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function burn(uint amount) external {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        totalSupply -= amount;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, address(0), amount);
    }
}
```

We'll mint 100 tokens to every user born before 01/01/2000.

Our users were issued verifiable credentials(VC) that contain the user's birthday date:

```json
  {
    "id": "8edd8112-c415-11ed-b036-debe37e1cbd6",
    "proofTypes": [
      "BJJSignature2021"
    ],
    "createdAt": "2023-03-20T11:54:01.110295+01:00",
    "expiresAt": "2025-03-20T11:54:01.110295+01:00",
    "expired": false,
    "schemaHash": "c9b2370371b7fa8b3dab2a5ba81b6838",
    "schemaType": "KYCAgeCredential",
    "schemaUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/main/schemas/json/KYCAgeCredential-v3.json",
    "revoked": false,
    "revNonce": 2136005230,
    "credentialSubject": {
      "birthday": 19960424,
      "documentType": 2,
      "id": "did:rarimo:2qDDDKmo436EZGCBAvkqZjADYoNRJszkG7UymZeCHQ"
    },
    "userID": "did:rarimo:2qFpPHotk6oyaX1fcrpQFT4BMnmg8YszUwxYtaoGoe"
  }
```



## Step 1: Implement the ZKPVerifier Hooks

We need to import <a href="https://github.com/iden3/contracts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iden3 contracts</a> and inherit the `ZKPVerifier` contract.

The ZKPVerifier Contract provides two hooks: `_beforeProofSubmit` and `_afterProofSubmit`.
These hooks are called before and after any proof gets submitted. We'll put our custom logic inside them.

Our contract must also define at least a single `TRANSFER_REQUEST_ID`. It is the identifier of the ZKP Request that we will create in the next step.


```
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import "./lib/GenesisUtils.sol";
import "./interfaces/ICircuitValidator.sol";
import "./verifiers/ZKPVerifier.sol";

contract ERC20Verifier is IERC20, ZKPVerifier {

    mapping(address => uint256) public addressToId;

    function _beforeProofSubmit(
        uint64, /* requestId */
        uint256[] memory inputs,
        ICircuitValidator validator
    ) internal view override {
        // checks that the challenge input of the proof is equal to the msg.sender
        address addr = GenesisUtils.int256ToAddress(
            inputs[validator.getInputOf("challenge")]
        );
        require(
            msg.sender == addr,
            "sender address is not an address in the proof."
        );
    }

    function _afterProofSubmit(
        uint64 requestId,
        uint256[] memory inputs,
        ICircuitValidator validator
    ) internal override {
        // your custom logic goes here

        // checks that proof was submitted only once by one user
        require(
            requestId == TRANSFER_REQUEST_ID && addressToId[msg.sender] == 0,
            "proof can not be submitted more than once."
        );

        uint256 id = inputs[validator.getInputOf("challenge")];

        // mint tokens
        addressToId[msg.sender] = id;
        super._mint(msg.sender, TOKENS_TO_MINT);
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Step 2: Set the ZKP Request

After the contract deployment, we should design a Request for our users and use it via the `setZKPRequest` function.

The `setZKPRequest` function has the following inputs:

1. `requestID`: the ID associated with the request (`1` in our contract).
1. `validator`: the address of the `Validator Smart Contract`. It's type can be either `CredentialAtomicQuerySigValidator` or `CredentialAtomicQueryMTPValidator` depending on how the credentials were issued.
1. `schema`: the bigInt representation of the schema of the requested credential.
1. `claimPathKey`: represents the path to the queries key inside the merklized credential (In our case it is the path to the `birthday` key).
1. `operator`: is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 (`less-than` operator we need is `2`).
1. `value`: represents the threshold value you are querying (01/01/2000 date in our case).

You can run https://go.dev/play/p/rnrRbxXTRY6 to get schema hash and claimPathKey using your schema.

This is how the example request would look like:

```json
{
    "id": "7f38a193-0918-4a48-9fac-36adfdb8b542",
    "typ": "application/iden3comm-plain-json",
    "type": "https://iden3-communication.io/proofs/1.0/contract-invoke-request",
    "thid": "7f38a193-0918-4a48-9fac-36adfdb8b542",
    "body": {
        "reason": <The reason why the proof is being asked, e.g. "age-restricted mint">,
        "transaction_data": {
            "contract_address": "<YourVerifierAddress>",
            "method_id": "b68967e2",
            "chain_id": <chain_id where your contract has been deployed, e.g. 80001>,
            "network": <the name of the network, where your the contract has been deployed, e.g. "polygon-mumbai">
        },
        "scope": [
            {
                "id": 2,
                "circuitId": "credentialAtomicQuerySigV2OnChain",
                "query": {
                    "allowedIssuers": [
                        "*"
                    ],
                    "context": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/main/schemas/json-ld/kyc-v3.json-ld",
                    "credentialSubject": {
                        "birthday": {
                            "$lt": 20000101
                        }
                    },
                    "type": "KYCAgeCredential"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Teststing It Out

<!-- TODO: add instruction how to generate a proof -->

Finally, to check that everything works as expected, you should generate a proof and submit it using the [`submitZKPResponse`](https://github.com/iden3/contracts/blob/9d3a3e8f62bfbebb0c82b0145665c15471ebe9f6/contracts/verifiers/ZKPVerifier.sol#L40C14-L40C31) method. As a result, you should receive 100 minted tokens at your address.
