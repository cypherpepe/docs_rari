# How to Set Up A Credentials Issuer

This article details the steps you can follow to set up your own Credentials Issuer, create your own credentials schema and issue the first credentials.

## Installation

Firstly, you will need to install <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker</a> via the provided link.
Running the app with Docker allows for minimal installation and a quick setup.
Then, you will need to clone <a href="https://github.com/rarimo/issuer-node/tree/feature/inclusion-mtp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the repository</a> (branch=feature/inclusion-mtp):

```git clone -b=feature/inclusion-mtp https://github.com/rarimo/issuer-node.git```

After cloning the repository you should do the following:
1. Generate Ethereum Private key for the Issuer Node (to sign on-chain transactions).
1. In the folder you've cloned rename `.env-api.example` to `.env-api`, `.env-ui.example` to `.env-ui` and `.env-issuer.example` to `.env-issuer`.
    - `.env-api` is used to configure the api-ui.
    This file allows the user to configure the basic auth of the api-ui, the server URL and others.
    - `.env-ui` is used to configure the api-ui.
    This file allows the user to configure the basic auth of the api-ui, the server URL and others.
    - `.env-issuer` is used to configure the api-issuer.
    It contains the needed configuration to start the node such as the infrastructure configuration (postgres/redis/vault), the blockchain variables in to be able to publish the state, the basic auth variables and other variables.
1. In the `.env-issuer` file you need to modify 17th line (`ISSUER_ETHEREUM_URL=<Ethereum URL of the Issuer>`) and set it to yours Ethereum RPC provider.
1. Run `sudo make build` in the cloned folder
1. After everything has builded, run `sudo make private_key=YOUR_ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY run-all` with generated Issuer's private key.

You should be able to enter `localhost:3001` (Issuer) and `localhost:3002` (Issuer UI API) now. 
We will use the first one in this guide.


## How to create Credentials Schemas

If you need to create your own Credentials Schemas (some of the schemas can be found <a href="https://github.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/tree/main/schemas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>) you can use either <a href="https://schema-builder.polygonid.me/builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PolygonID Schema Builder</a> (recommended option) or you can write it by yourself and import it, using Issuer UI API.


### Creating a Schema with PolygonID Schema Builder

To create the schema using PolygonID Builder, follow these steps:

1. Enter the title, type, version and description of your schema
![Schema data](/img/schema-builder-1.png)
1. Define the attributes. Let's add the date of birth and the full name for this example.
![Schema attributes](/img/schema-builder-2.png)
1. After clicking on "Add" button, new attribute will appear and you need to change it's name, title, type, description and set the checkbox, whether it is required or not
![New Attribute](/img/schema-builder-3.png)
1. You can also set additional restrictions by clicking on "Advanced" button
![Advanced settings](/img/schema-builder-4.png)
1. After you've finished, you can copy it from the right window or download by pressing on "Download JSON" button below the properties
![Receiving the Schema](/img/schema-builder-5.png)
1. You should then post it somewhere (e.g. on GitHub) and paste the link into `url` field at the `Import JSON schema` in the Issuer UI API.
You should also copy the type, title, description and version from the posted schema

## Issuing Credentials

After the Issuer Node has been set up, we can issue our first credentials.
API documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/rarimo/issuer-node/blob/main/api/api.yaml).

Follow these steps:

1. The Issuer is also an identity, so we need to create one.
To do that, open `localhost:3001` and select "Create Identity" in the left sidebar.
![Identity Creation](/img/issuer-issue-1.png)
1. Fill `method`, `blockchain` and `network`. 
You can leave the last two empty, but the method should be specified.
We will use method `iden3` without specifying blockchain and network.
We will also create an identity for the user, so we can issue credentials to him.
![Identity Created, using iden3 method](/img/issuer-issue-2.png)
1. After creating both identities (or receiving the user's identity from him), we can issue our first claim.
To do that, press "Create Claim" button and paste the Issuer identifier (our firstly generated id) and user's id in the `id` field below:
![Create Claim](/img/issuer-issue-3.png)
1. We can check our claim using "Get Claim" endpoint:
![Get Claim](/img/issuer-issue-4.png)
1. The last thing we need to do is publish the state of our issuer on-chain
![State publishing](/img/issuer-issue-5.png)
1. Now, we can send to the user MTP of Claim inclusion in the tree, using "Get Claim MTP"

## Issuing via API

We can also issue credentials, using UI API.
You can do this either by opening `localhost:3002` or via curl requests.
UI API documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/rarimo/issuer-node/blob/main/api_ui/api.yaml).

Follow these steps:
1. Let's issue credentials to previously created identity:
    - the `authorization` field is Base64 encoded username and password
    - we will change the `id` (receiver's did), `birthday` and `expiration` fields
    ```
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:3002/v1/credentials" \
    -H "accept: application/json"\
    -H "authorization: Basic dXNlci1hcGk6cGFzc3dvcmQtYXBp"\
    -H "content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "credentialSchema":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/main/schemas/json/KYCAgeCredential-v3.json",
        "type":"KYCAgeCredential",
        "credentialSubject":{
            "id":"did:iden3:tQdm5KtrBAsQApF5445Wo4p8f1D5QKmAEpKWSxQaG",
            "birthday":20000101,
            "documentType":2
            },
        "expiration":"2023-10-27T10:56:42.618Z",
        "signatureProof":true,
        "mtProof":true }'
    ```
    The response would be the credentials id:
    ```
    {
        "id":"b326c436-6f58-11ee-8dab-0242ac120007"
    }
    ```
1. After credentials are issued, we can publish our issuer's identity state on-chain:
    ```
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:3002/v1/state/publish" \
    -H "accept: application/json"\
    -H "authorization: Basic dXNlci1hcGk6cGFzc3dvcmQtYXBp" 
    ```
    The response would be the new state, new tree roots and the txID:
    ```json
    {
        "claimsTreeRoot":"c8d09a3e4fc89ce6407ac96ea6e007b68cdd2e853b945c5f9baf70af3faf0510",
        "revocationTreeRoot":"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "rootOfRoots":"2c2db5c1ef764b48ca0cdf186208f7de940114b1c42061a89d3851beeb956c28",
        "state":"6f511e29380a28bb47cbc628ae6b20a1df2169c3cfec46fef07bc5c7ab3e6819",
        "txID":"0xbde3732071c9947d43a46175e47b6604b924e273ce86898f76ff621b6e48691b"
    }
    ```
1. Finally, we can do a request to the Issuer API and check that credentials exist in the tree and also receive MTP of existence:

   ```
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/v1/claims/b326c436-6f58-11ee-8dab-0242ac120007/mtp" \
    -H "accept: application/json"
   ```

    The response would be the information about issuer and mtp (of existence in our case):

    ```json
     {
         "issuer":{
             "claimTreeRoot":"c8d09a3e4fc89ce6407ac96ea6e007b68cdd2e853b945c5f9baf70af3faf0510",
             "revocationTreeRoot":"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
             "rootOfRoots":"2c2db5c1ef764b48ca0cdf186208f7de940114b1c42061a89d3851beeb956c28",
             "state":"6f511e29380a28bb47cbc628ae6b20a1df2169c3cfec46fef07bc5c7ab3e6819"
         },
         "mtp":{
             "existence":true,
             "siblings":[
                 "10737733873451827385669539393513485246847702080273815461038732999844382514192"
             ]
         }
     }
    ```
