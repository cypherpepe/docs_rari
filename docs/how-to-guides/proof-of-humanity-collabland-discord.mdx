# Protecting Your Discord Server from Bots with Proof of Humanity and Collab.Land

A typical crypto discord server is constantly attacked by bots shilling scams. Banning them manually wastes your mods' and users' time. Basic protection measures, like captcha verification, do little good, either.

Rarimo has developed a free plugin for the popular token-gating bot [Collab.Land](https://www.collab.land/) to fight this menace. It allows the server admin to set up channels for verified humans only.

## Configuring the Collab.Land Bot

### Prerequisites

Invite the Collab.Land bot to your server by following this [guide](https://collabland.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/70000036689-discord-bot-walkthrough
).

### Step #1:  Create a Discord Role for Humans

Colla.Land's token gating rules are based on discord roles, so we need to create a role for the verified users by following this [guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-Setting-Up-Permissions-FAQ#h_01FFTVYQ38W9TVCTM6YZHZXFFA).

Let's call our role `Certified Human✅`.

### Step #3: Set Up a Token-Gating Rule

1. Click on the "TGRs" tab in the Collab.Land console:
1. Click on the "Select Role" button:
1. Select the role you created in Step #1 and click "Apply":
1. Fill in the following fields and verify that the screenshot below matches your form:
    - Chain: `Polygon`;

    - Addresses: `0xaD7De01cb7eaAFf3a419A0a0a3133a964cD90373`([reference](/reference/proof-of-humanity#deployments));
1. Click "Save" and verify that you see the following screen:
