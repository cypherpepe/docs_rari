# @rarimo/provider

The [@rarimo/provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/provider) package provides access to in-browser wallets such as Metamask.

For information about connecting to wallets, see [Connecting to wallets](../overview/connecting-to-wallets).

For example applications, see [rarimo/js-sdk-examples](https://github.com/rarimo/js-sdk-examples/) on GitHub.

## Provider types

The SDK supports these wallet types with their matching provider classes:

- [`CoinbaseProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_provider.CoinbaseProvider.html): Coinbase wallets
- [`MetamaskProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_provider.MetamaskProvider.html): Metamask wallets
- [`NearProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_provider.NearProvider.html): NEAR wallets
- [`PhantomProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_provider.PhantomProvider.html): Phantom wallets
- [`SolflareProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_provider.SolflareProvider.html): Solflare wallets

## Methods and properties

These classes all implement the [`IProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/interfaces/_rarimo_provider.IProvider.html) interface, which allows you to work with different wallet types in a consistent way.
In this way, each provider has these main methods:

- [`connect()`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/interfaces/_rarimo_provider.IProvider.html#connect): Connects to the wallet, prompting the user to log in if necessary.

After you connect, you can access information about the wallet with these properties of the provider object:

- `address`: The wallet address
- `providerType`: The type of wallet, such as `metamask`
- `chainType`: The type of chain from the [`ChainTypes`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/enums/_rarimo_provider.ChainTypes.html) enumeration, such as EVM, Near, or Solana

Many other methods and properties are available.
For complete information about providers, see the [@rarimo/provider](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/modules/_rarimo_provider.html) SDK reference.
