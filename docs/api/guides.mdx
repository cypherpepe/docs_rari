# Guides

Rarimo's API can be used as a utility to help power your integration.
It surfaces information about the protocol, similar to these docs, that developers and applications can use to build flows.
Since our API is free to use, you can experiment as much as you want without worrying about bumping into any limitations.

## FAQ
