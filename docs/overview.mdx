# Getting started

Rarimo is a multichain protocol developed to solve the problems of **liquidity**, **access**, and **interoperability** across non-fungible and fungible use-cases.
We have created a suite of tools that make it easy to build ground-breaking integrations on top of our technology.

See the information in the left pane for things that you can do with the protocol.

For information on the platform, see these pages:

- [Core concepts](./design) | How the protocol works
- [Smart Contracts](./smart-contracts) | Rarimo's contracts on supported chains
- [SDK](./sdk) | JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for handling transactions
- [Developers](./developers) | Information about contributing to the platform

All of our tools are open source and free to use.
We welcome questions, feedback, and collaboration on all levels as we work together to build a platform-agnostic, untethered internet of the future.
