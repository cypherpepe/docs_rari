# What is Rarimo?

Rarimo is building a permissionless ZK Registry for identities, user interactions, and other components of the social graph. This infrastructure enables privacy-focused social apps, allowing users to selectively disclose information while keeping other aspects of their social data private. With Rarimo, developers can create apps that respect user anonymity without discarding historical interactions or identity continuity.

## What is a ZK Registry?

The ZK Registry is a zkRollup that functions as an on-chain registry for abstract statements. It enables proving the system's state without revealing details about individual statements. This zero-knowledge approach boosts the reusability, scalability, and security of privacy-focused applications. By centralizing standardized, provable statements in a permissionless registry, the ZK Registry provides a flexible foundation for many use cases. Developers can implement protocols like identity verification, reputation, and proof-of-attendance with minimal effort, making it easier to build privacy-preserving applications.

## Why a zkRollup?

Rarimo's legacy setup operates as a Cosmos-based Layer 1 chain with an EVM module. While having an own Layer 1 has its benefits, it has also introduced friction for both end users and DApp developers. The next iteration of Rarimo will shift to a zkRollup to leverage Ethereum's security and interoperability, all while keeping the chain affordable and flexible. Additionally, ZK Registry updates can be propagated to other Layer 1 networks, enabling seamless synchronization of root states across multiple ecosystems.

## Ecosystem

Several applications are being built on top of Rarimo:

- [**RariMe App**](/rarime-app): A self-sovereign mobile wallet for managing digital identity.
- [**ZK Passport**](/zk-passport): Transforms biometric passports into privacy-preserving digital identities.
- [**ZK Reputation**](/zk-reputation): Allows users to prove their reputation without compromising privacy.
- [**Freedom Tool**](/freedom-tool): A privacy-preserving voting solution designed for e-democracy.

## Can I use it now?

Yes and no. While the Rarimo ZK Registry is still under development, you can already access and use technologies like the RariMe App, ZK Passport, and Freedom Tool.
