# Overview

Rarimo is a multi-chain protocol developed to solve the problems of **liquidity**, **access**, and **interoperability** across non-fungible and fungible use-cases.
Rarimo makes it easier to work across different chains, allowing you to do things like transfer tokens, stake tokens, and provide proofs of ownership across chains.

We have created a suite of tools, including an API and JavaScript/TypeScript SDK, that make it easy to build ground-breaking integrations on top of our technology.

- [Core concepts](./architecture) | How the protocol works and how it is structured
- [Smart Contracts](./reference/contracts) | Rarimo's contracts on supported chains
- [API](./api) | The Rarimo core API
- [SDK](./sdk) | JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for handling transactions

All of our tools are open source and free to use.
We welcome questions, feedback, and collaboration on all levels as we work together to build a platform-agnostic, untethered internet of the future.

## Use cases

The primary purpose of the Rarimo protocol is to remove barriers between chains and token types.
The protocol simplifies transactions that require converting one type of token into another, moving tokens from one chain to another, or maintaining pools of tokens on multiple chains.

You can use the protocol for many use multi-chain cases, including:

- Accepting any token from any chain as payment for NFT purchases
- Creating seamless cross-chain token transfers
- Building liquidity pools that allow you to work with many chains simultaneously
- Allowing users to stake tokens across different chains
- Airdropping NFTs to multiple chains
- Proving ownership of tokens across chains
