# Overview

Rarimo is a multichain protocol developed to solve the problems of **liquidity**, **access**, and **interoperability** across non-fungible and fungible use-cases.
We have created a suite of tools that make it easy to build ground-breaking integrations on top of our technology.

- [Smart Contracts](./smart-contracts) | Rarimo's contracts on supported chains
- [API](./api) | programmatic references for working with our contracts
- [SDK](./sdk) | JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for handling transactions
- [Solutions](./solutions) | bundled components for common problems

All of our tools are open source and free to use.
We welcome questions, feedback, and collaboration on all levels as we work together to build a platform-agnostic, untethered internet of the future.
