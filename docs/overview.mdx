# What is Rarimo?

Rarimo is a privacy-first (zk) social protocol designed to facilitate the development of a new generation of social apps. Traditionally, social apps have had to balance user privacy against engagement. Rarimo resolves this tradeoff by enabling users to interact anonymously while maintaining a history of their actions, connections, and identity attributes. With Rarimo, users can selectively disclose specific information while keeping other aspects of their social graph private.

The Rarimo Protocol is built on three foundational components:
- **Self-Issued Identity Framework**: This ensures that only verified, real individuals can participate in social apps, enhancing trust and authenticity.
- **Private Social Graph**: This infrastructure supports private yet verifiable social interactions, allowing users to engage without compromising their privacy.
**RariMe App**: This is a self-sovereign wallet for managing your identity, giving users full control over their personal data.

Let's explore these components in detail to understand how the Rarimo Protocol operates.

## Verifiable self-issued identity framework

Creating a pseudonymous account without linking it to a real person is easy, but such identities often lead to issues like fake accounts (Sybil attacks) that disrupt social interactions.

Traditionally, identity verification involves a trusted issuer that authenticates users. This approach poses risks as the issuer could compromise privacy or be shut down. Verifying user uniqueness might require sharing sensitive data, like government IDs, which increases privacy risks.

Rarimo offers a solution by allowing users to establish their identity using only their government-issued biometric documents without needing a third-party issuer. Here's how it works:

1. **Keypair generation**: The user generates a keypair on their device.
2. **Biometric document scan**: The user scans their biometric document using the RariMe App.
3. **Registration**: The keypair is bound to the passport by submitting a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) of passport validity and the public key to the registration smart contract.

This process allows users to verify their humanity, assert their uniqueness, or selectively disclose passport attributes (like citizenship or legal age) using ZKPs without revealing private data to any third party. The proofs can be verified both on-chain and off-chain.

Additionally, the app calculates a hash of the passport's public key (Active Authentication Public Key), serving as the passport's unique identifier. This hash is stored in the registration smart contract to prevent multiple registrations with the same document.

To mitigate potential "dictionary" attacks, where a passport issuer or third party might try to identify registered passports by hashing known values, Rarimo maintains a global Merkle tree of passport hashes. This tree is shared across all social apps, providing plausible deniability for users and preventing attackers from deducing participation in specific applications. The more passports and social apps accumulate over time, the more robust this identity system becomes.


## Private Social Graph

The Rarimo protocol enables the creation of private social graphs. These graphs consist of user actions and interactions that remain invisible to the public until the owner selectively discloses them using zero-knowledge proofs. This ensures user privacy while allowing for verifiable claims.

**Examples of ZK proofs**:
- **Credential and Attestation Ownership**: Proving ownership of a credential or attestation at a specific time.
- **Action Initiation**: Proving that a particular user or group initiated certain actions.
- **Group Membership**: Proving that a user is a member of a specific group.

To achieve this, Rarimo provides a set of data structures for creating on-chain anchors of the social graph data, which can be used in zero-knowledge proofs. These data structures include:

- **Commitments**: Secure, private statements about user actions or attributes.
- **Commitment Trees**: Hierarchical structures that organize commitments, enabling efficient and scalable storage on-chain.

These structures allow users to maintain a private yet verifiable record of their social interactions, ensuring both privacy and authenticity.

## RariMe App

The RariMe App is a mobile self-custody wallet designed to provide private yet verifiable social identities. During signup, the app uses the phone's camera and NFC chip to scan the user's biometric documents. The app ensures that no user data is shared with any party unless the user explicitly chooses to disclose certain aspects of their identity using zero-knowledge proofs.

**Key features:**

- **Biometric document scanning**: Utilizes the camera and NFC chip to scan and verify user documents securely.
- **Privacy-by-Default**: Guarantees user data remains private.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Allows users to selectively disclose specific identity attributes without revealing private data.

The RariMe App empowers users with control over their identity, ensuring both privacy and verifiability in social interactions.

## Ecosystem

Building on Rarimo technology, the following ecosystem products have been created:

- **Freedom Tool**: A zero-knowledge-enabled tool for transparent and privacy-preserving online voting.
- **Proof of Humanity**: Aggregates the most popular proof of humanity solutions into a single interface, available both on and off-chain.
- **Polygon ID State Replication**: Enables the scaling of Polygon ID credentials to any EVM-compatible chain on demand.
- **World ID State Replication**: Facilitates the scaling of WorldID proofs to any EVM-compatible chain on demand.
