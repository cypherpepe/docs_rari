# Overview

##  What is Rarimo

Rarimo is a privacy-first social protocol that seamlessly combines various identity standards on-chain and off-chain and allows the formation of a private yet verifiable history of their use and relations.

<!-- TODO: a diagram? -->

At the core of the Rarimo Social Protocol are three design pillars:

1. **Control**. Users should have exclusive authority over managing their identity and all connected attributes. Optionally, specific processes (e.g., identity recovery) can involve trusted parties for additional protection, but only at the user's request.
1. **Privacy**. Sensitive data must remain inaccessible to third parties. The user should decide what information to share, when, and with whom. While some protocols may require verifying the user's uniqueness, this should not compromise the privacy of personal information.
1. **Compatibility**. The digital identity solution should support various industry standards, such as W3C DID credentials, soulbound tokens (SBTs), ENS records, etc. Each of these identity formats offers unique advantages; therefore, the social protocol must allow interoperability among them. Additionally, it should support both off-chain and on-chain verification methods.

The most significant aspect of identity is its relationships with other identities, including bidirectional attestations, shared communion, and participation. However, these should be private by default and disclosed only upon request.

## Why Rarimo?

Rarimo believes that social protocols are the next frontier for Web3. A robust digital identity system is a prerequisite for building a social graph is a robust digital identity system. The current landscape of digital identity management faces significant challenges in maintaining ownership privacy and ensuring untraceability for its users. Soulbond tokens and similar on-chain solutions, while useful in representing ownership and attributes, need to provide comprehensive control and privacy guarantees. Self-sovereign identity solutions offer means to create accounts and associate attributes privately, yet they lack the inter-account relationship mapping crucial for building social graphs.

Let's examine the building blocks of digital identity in web3 space:

- Account addresses, which denote asset ownership and balance.
- NFT and SBT tokens signifying memberships and attributes
- Verifiable Credentials representing statements
- Web services that bridge web3 applications with the traditional web
- Document-derived artifacts representing legal documents to be integrated and utilized within web3.

From these separately evolving building blocks, three primary challenges emerge:
- **Identity fragmentation and a lack of interoperability**: It is difficult for DApps to verify users accurately from different ecosystems, which obstructs the unification of identity components across different chains.
- **Privacy concerns**: Maintaining a reasonable level of anonymity or managing sensitive data on-chain proves difficult. Currently, only protocols incorporating zero-knowledge proofs effectively address these privacy issues.
- **Complex identity verification algorithms**: The challenge of building a universal identity query that covers all potential scenarios complicates identity verification. Although verification methods are robust, a standardized API is essential for developing applications that can navigate this complexity.

Rarimo aims to solve these challenges by providing a robust baselayer and diverse ZK-enabled identity tools.

## Rarimo architecture

### Rarimo Core

The Rarimo Core is a decentralized blockchain-based system designed for timestamping, storing, and updating identity states and social relations that other networks and protocols can use. It is maintained by a set of validators that achieve consensus using the BFT-based delegated Proof-of-Stake mechanism. The chain has instant finality and supports EVM-compatible smart contracts. Additionally, Rarimo Core allows the efficient on-demand propagation of identity states over connected networks using decentralized oracles.

### Social Protocol

The social protocol consists of two key sub-protocols:
Zero-knowledge identity protocol based on Iden3 standard
Biometric passport-derived profiles

The Iden3 protocol is suitable for receiving identity statements in a Verifiable Credential format. Rarimo allows identity providers to publish only state hashes into the Rarimo blockchain. After propagating to connected networks, DApps can use the mentioned states to verify various zero-knowledge identity statements. This flow presumes the identity provider issues Verifiable Credentials and pushes their state in the Rarimo Core or connected blockchains. Periodically or upon request, identity states are broadcast across connected networks, making them accessible to end-users directly on the requested chains.

Passport-derived profiles enable users to set up an identity solely with their government-issued documents without needing a third-party issuer. Using this functionality, users can verify the authenticity of their documents without disclosing their personal information, thereby creating a profile linked to the specified data. Once the identity profile is established, users can demonstrate the validity of certain information within their documents and ensure the uniqueness of the identity for the application in use. From the cryptographic perspective, passport-derived profiles are compatible with the Iden3 protocol. Users can create passport-derived profiles and connect additional verifiable credentials or attributes. Additionally, identity providers can track passport revocation events and automatically revoke/reissue Verifiable Credentials.

### Applications

Rarimo provides a set of applications that leverage the Rarimo Core and Social Protocol to offer a seamless user experience. These applications include:

- **RariMe**: Identity wallet that allows users to manage their digital identity and social relations, generate zero-knowledge proofs, and much more. Available as a mobile app and a MetaMask snap.
- **Freedom Tool**: A ZK-enabled tool for transparent and privacy-preserving online voting.
- **Proof of Humanity**: Aggregates the most popular proof of humanity solutions into a single interface available on and off-chain.
- **Polygon ID State Replication**: Scales use of Polygon ID credentials to any EVM-compatible chain on demand.
- **World ID State Replication**: Scales use of WolrdID proofs to any EVM-compatible chain on demand.
