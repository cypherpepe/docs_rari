# What is Rarimo?

Rarimo is building a permissionless ZK Registry for identities, user interactions, and other components of the social graph. This infrastructure enables privacy-focused social apps, allowing users to selectively disclose information while keeping other aspects of their social data private. With Rarimo, developers can create apps that respect user anonymity without discarding historical interactions or identity continuity.

## What is a ZK Registry?

The ZK Registry is a ZK Rollup that functions as an on-chain registry for abstract statements. It enables proving the system's state without revealing details about individual statements. By aggregating standardized, provable statements in a permissionless registry, the ZK Registry provides a flexible foundation for many use cases. Developers can implement protocols like identity verification, reputation, and proof-of-attendance with minimal effort, making it easier to build privacy-preserving applications.

## Strong self-issued identities with ZK Passport

ZK Passport Registry transforms biometric passports into unique, privacy-preserving digital identities. Unlike most solutions, it combines decentralized issuance, reliable uniqueness verification, and privacy.

Decentralization is achieved through self-issuance: since passports already contain the necessary validity data, no third-party issuer is needed, making it self-serve and resistant to shut down.

Uniqueness is ensured by publishing passport hashes on-chain, allowing users to prove their inclusion in the registry. With each additional user and application, privacy strengthens through a network effect, making it increasingly challenging to deduce individual actions, whether related to protests or meme coins.

## ZK Reputation

ZK Reputation Registry allows users to prove their reputation based on private relationships and interactions.

## Launch your own ZK Registry

ZK Registry is entirely open-source and built with extensibility in mind. If your DApp can benefit from private yet provable data, bring it on!

## Why a ZK Rollup?

Rarimo's legacy setup operates as a Cosmos-based Layer 1 chain with an EVM module. While having an own Layer 1 has its benefits, it has also introduced friction for both end users and DApp developers. The next iteration of Rarimo will shift to a zkRollup to leverage Ethereum's security and interoperability, all while keeping the chain affordable and flexible. Additionally, ZK Registry updates can be propagated to other Layer 1 networks, enabling seamless synchronization of root states across multiple ecosystems.

## Ecosystem

Several applications are being built on top of Rarimo:

- [**RariMe App**](/rarime-app): A self-sovereign mobile wallet for managing digital identity.
- [**Freedom Tool**](/freedom-tool): A privacy-preserving voting solution designed for e-democracy.

## Can I use it now?

Yes and no. While the Rarimo ZK Registry is still under development, you can already access and use technologies like the RariMe App, ZK Passport, and Freedom Tool.
