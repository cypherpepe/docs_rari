# What is Rarimo?

Rarimo is building a permissionless ZK Registry that redefines how identities, interactions, and social graphs are managed. Unlike traditional identity protocols that depend on centralized issuers or specialized hardware, Rarimo uses client-side proving to deliver a truly censorship-resistant backbone. Instead of striving to build a universal identity, Rarimo embraces a pluralistic approach. This empowers developers to create applications that respect user anonymity while preserving historical interactions and ensuring continuity of identity.

## What is a ZK Registry?

The ZK Registry is a ZK Rollup that functions as an on-chain registry for abstract statements. It enables proving the system's state without revealing details about individual statements. By aggregating standardized, provable statements in a permissionless registry, the ZK Registry provides a flexible foundation for many use cases. Developers can implement protocols like identity verification, reputation, and proof-of-attendance with minimal effort, making it easier to build privacy-preserving applications.

## Permissionless self-issued identities with ZK Passport

ZK Passport Registry transforms biometric passports into unique, privacy-preserving digital identities. Unlike most solutions, it combines decentralized infrastructure, reliable uniqueness verification, and privacy.

*Decentralization* is achieved through self-issuance: since passports already contain the necessary validity data, no third-party issuer is needed, making it self-serve and resistant to shutdown.

*Uniqueness* is ensured by publishing passport hashes on-chain, allowing users to prove their inclusion in the registry. With each additional user and application, privacy strengthens through a network effect, making it increasingly challenging to deduce individual actions, whether related to protests or meme coins.

## ZK Reputation

The ZK Reputation Registry allows users to prove their reputation based on private relationships and interactions, without exposing sensitive details. By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, users can verify their trustworthiness and standing in various communities while maintaining complete control over their privacy.

## Launch your own ZK Registry

ZK Registry is entirely open-source and built with extensibility in mind. If your DApp can benefit from private yet provable data, bring it on!

## Why a ZK Rollup?

Rarimo deploys the ZK Registry to a dedicated ZK Rollup to leverage Ethereum's security and interoperability while maintaining affordability and flexibility. Additionally, ZK Registry updates can be propagated to other Layer 1 networks, ensuring seamless synchronization of root states across multiple ecosystems.

## Ecosystem

Several applications are being built on top of Rarimo:

- [**RariMe App**](/rarime-app): A self-sovereign mobile wallet for managing digital identity.
- [**Freedom Tool**](/freedom-tool): A privacy-preserving voting solution designed for e-democracy.

## Can I use it now?

Yes and no. While the Rarimo ZK Registry is still under development, you can already access and use technologies like the RariMe App, ZK Passport, and Freedom Tool.
