# Security

Rarimo relies on the use of TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme) to ensure secure, efficient protocol security.
With TSS, there is no direct relationship between the number of validators and the size of the signature.
We can scale our pool of validators to handle increased throughput while keeping our fees at a low, fixed rate.

## Audits

Our protocol and smart contracts have been audited by some of the industry's most trusted companies.

> should we upload the audit results?

## Integrations

Rarimo isn't just interested in the security of our systems.
We also want to make sure that any partner who integrates with us, on any level, is also secure.
If you are interested in coordinating with our team, or connecting with our network of auditors, please reach out to our team!
