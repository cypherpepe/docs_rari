# Issuing credentials (coming soon)

Applications can use Rarimo's cross-chain protocol to manage [decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) and make them available to any connected chain.

These applications, referred to as identity providers, publish a state hash that includes identity states for one or more users.
For example, a university might publish a state that includes identities for its graduates, with each identity including the degrees that the graduate has earned.

Rarimo then broadcasts these states to other chains so other applications can generate and verify zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) based on these identities.
This diagram shows how this publishing works, from the identity providers adding states to Rarimo and Rarimo sharing these states with chains:
