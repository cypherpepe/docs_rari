# Applications

Our protocol has limitless potential with its future-facing design.
Any messaging, asset, and operability that is possible on a single blockchain will be unlocked for all users across chains.
We have already created one sub-protocol, which can safely transfer assets across chains.
We are not limited by this one - and are already planning future sub-protocols to support upcoming applications.

## Cross-Chain NFT Settlement

It is complex and requires multiple steps for users with tokens on different blockchains to buy NFTs from a marketplace.
If a user holds liquidity on `Chain A` and an NFT exists on `Chain B`, there is no easy solution for the user to purchase the NFT.
They must leave the marketplace, find an exchange, execute a swap (and be subject to the swap fees), return to the marketplace, and then execute a trade.

With Rarimo's protocol, a user can perform a single transaction to make a cross-chain purchase.
Also, with our bundling, this means a single gas fee for a secure, atomic transaction.

## Cross-Chain Listing

Creator platforms are limited to single chains and marketplaces, alienating them from potential users and customers.
There is no easy way to allow minting on `Chain A` and listing on marketplaces that are on `Chain B`.

We can allow users to mint, list, and trade on the chains that make sense for them, increasing community reach.
Again, our bundling design means that multiple steps can occur within a single transaction.

## Cross-Chain Proofs

Verification of ownership / provenance of non-fungible assets are limited to a single chain.
dApps on `Chain A` can only cater to users on that chain - any users with assets on `Chain B` cannot interact.
This limits reach, especially for non-transferable assets like Soul-Bound Tokens (SBTs).

Rarimo's protocol allows cross-chain proofs.
Token-gated access logic, DAO membership, voting rights, and other ownership rights can be checked cross-chain.
