# Overview of use cases

One of the key features that distinguishes Rarimo from all other interoperability bridges is its focus on decentralized identities and credentials.
By making metadata retrievable and replicating state, Rarimo enables tokens, Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), dynamic NFTs, and other components of onchain identity to seamlessly travel across ecosystems.

Rarimo dramatically improves the user experience of interacting with multi-chain digital assets by eliminating excess transaction fees and time-consuming manual steps from an endless range of use cases.
Instead, Rarimo offers users single-click, single-fee solutions.

These are the main use cases of the Protocol that are available today:

## Token-agnostic NFT checkout

If a user holds tokens on one chain and an NFT is for sale on another chain, there is no easy way for the user to purchase the NFT with those tokens.

They must leave the marketplace, use an exchange, execute a swap (and be subject to the swap fees), return to the marketplace, and then execute a trade.

With Rarimo's NFT Checkout solution, users can purchase NFTs with non-native tokens.
At checkout, users will be prompted to select the currency they like to pay with from the balance, and after paying the transaction fee and signing to authorize the payment, the process will be complete.
Rarimo bundles the different steps into a secure, atomic transaction with a single gas fee.

## Cross-chain proofs

There is no way for dApps to verify the state or ownership of social tokens in the form of credentials, digital identities, soul-bound tokens, and other NFTs across chains, as they are restricted to their native ecosystems.

Rarimo's protocol allows cross-chain proofs, token-gated access logic, DAO membership, voting rights to be executed across the ecosystems.

By using Rarimo, cross-chain proofs can be generated, or their state can be replicated across different chains.
This allows digital credentials, soul-bound tokens, and dynamic NFTs to transcend the confines of a single chain or ecosystem.

## Cross-chain NFT/credential minting

Rarimo can simplify the process of minting tokens on multiple chains.
In this case, the token issuer sends only one transaction to lock tokens, and users can redeem tokens on any chain of their choice.
Token standards include NFTs, SBTs, and semi-fungible tokens.

## Cross-chain staking

Through bundling functionality, the required steps for users are simplified to a single step.
Users only need to send a transaction to lock their tokens, and the protocol will bridge the assets to the
target chain and stake them.
