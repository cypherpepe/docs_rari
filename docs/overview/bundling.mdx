# Bundling

Rarimo's cross-chain protocol allows multiple events to occur within a single transaction.
User actions are often complex and requires multiple steps to achieve a goal.
While other protocols would require a user (or application) to send unique transactions for each step, Rarimo's protocol permits bundling multiple steps.

## Example

This high-level example demonstrates how our bundling can simplify a user flow.

Alice has an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.
They want to stake this NFT in a DeFi application on the Polygon blockchain.
Normally, this would entail the following transactions:

1. Locking of the NFT on Etherum network.
1. Redemption of NFT on Polygon network.
1. Staking NFT in the DeFi application.

Each of these transactions would be subjected to gas fees and could fail independently.
This is why we designed Rarimo to have bundled transactions on the destination chain.
Our bundled transactions handles all of these steps efficiently with a single request, incurring one gas fee and behaving atomically.

## Implementation

When a token is locked in one of Rarimo's contracts, users can specify additional contracts and methods to be called on the destination chain.
Rarimo while sign these parameters when checking the event and execute them.
Methods that call custom contracts will not be overridable, protecting transactions from re-entrancy attacks.

### Benefits

- Our protocol will have efficient gas usage for end users
- Transactions on the destination chain will succeed or fail together
- Development is easier with this approach
- Any address can handle the transaction calls and gas fees on behalf of the original requestor

### Limitations

- Transaction bundling only works with EVM networks
- ERC1155 token transfers cannot use bundling
