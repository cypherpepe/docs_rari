# Bundling

Rarimo's multichain protocol bundles multiple related events into single transactions.
In this way, the protocol simplifies complex, multistep user actions.

Bundling also allows Rarimo to include custom logic with transactions.
Rarimo contracts use this logic to run actions that follow an initial transaction, such as unlocking tokens on other chains and buying NFTs by calling other contracts.

## Example

This high-level example demonstrates how bundling can simplify a user flow:

Alice has an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain.
They want to stake this NFT in a DeFi application on the Polygon blockchain.
Normally, staking an NFT requires multiple transactions:

1. Lock the NFT on the Etherum network.
1. Redeem the NFT on the Polygon network.
1. Stake the NFT in the DeFi application.

Separately, each of these transactions incur gas fees and can fail independently.
This is why we designed Rarimo to bundle transactions on the destination chain.
Our bundled transactions handle these steps efficiently with a single request, incurring a single gas fee and behaving atomically.

## Implementation

When a transaction locks a token in a Rarimo contract, users can specify additional contracts and methods to call on the destination chain.
The Rarimo contract signs and runs these additional transactions automatically.
Methods that call custom contracts are not overridable, which protects transactions from re-entrancy attacks.

### Benefits

- The protocol has efficient gas usage for end users
- Transactions on the destination chain will succeed or fail together
- The development flow can be simplified
- Any address can handle transaction calls and gas fees on behalf of the original requestor

### Limitations

- Transaction bundling works only with EVM networks
- ERC1155 token transfers cannot use bundling
