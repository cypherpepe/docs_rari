# Connecting to wallets

You can connect to browser-based wallets such as Metamask with the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK.
See the following sections:

- [Connecting to wallets in JavaScript/TypeScript applications](#javascript)
- [Connecting to wallets in React applications](#react-applications)

## Examples

These examples show how to connect to wallets:

- The example [wallet-access](https://github.com/rarimo/js-sdk-examples/) shows how to connect to a wallet without using React.
- The example [wallet-access-react](https://github.com/rarimo/js-sdk-examples/tree/main/wallet-access-react) shows how to connect to a wallet in a React application.

## Connecting to wallets in JavaScript/TypeScript applications {#javascript}

The [@rarimo/provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/provider) package provides tools that provide access to wallets.

To connect to a wallet, first use the `createProvider()` function to create the appropriate class of provider object, which represents the wallet.

Then, run the object's `connect()` method to prompt the user to log in to the wallet.
This connect step runs automatically if you initiate a transaction with the provider object.

Here is an example that creates a MetamaskProvider object for a MetaMask wallet and prints information about it:

```ts
import { createProvider, MetamaskProvider, ChainTypes } from '@rarimo/provider'

const getMetamaskWalletInfo = async () => {
  // Connect to the Metamask wallet in the browser using Web3.js, using the MetamaskProvider interface to limit bundle size.
  const provider = await createProvider(MetamaskProvider)
  await provider.connect()

  // Get the address of the wallet
  console.log('Address:', provider.address)
  console.log('chainType:', ChainTypes[provider.chainType!])
  console.log('providerType:', provider.providerType)
}
```

For information about the wallets that the SDK supports and other things that you can do with wallet providers, see [`@rarimo/provider`](../sdk/provider).

## Connecting to wallets in React applications {#react-applications}

The [@rarimo/react-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/react-provider) package provides the `useProvider` hook, which allows React applications to access wallets.

To connect to a wallet, import the `useProvider` hook create the appropriate wallet provider object from the [@rarimo/provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/provider) package.
Then you can use the provider object to get information about the wallet or run transactions with it, as in this example:

```ts
import { MetamaskProvider } from '@rarimo/provider'
import { useProvider } from '@rarimo/react-provider'

function App() {
  const { provider, ...rest } = useProvider(MetamaskProvider)

  provider?.connect()
  console.log(provider?.address)

  return <div className="App">Wallet address: {provider?.address}</div>
}

export default App
```
