# Cross-Chain NFT/Credentials Minting

Rarimo can simplify the flow for airdropping NFTs on multiple chains. The collection owner sends only one transaction to lock tokens, and users can redeem them in any chain supported by Rarimo.

## User Flow

For a User the process is straightforward:

1. Select the destination chain and receiver address in the dApp;
1. Approve the transaction in the wallet provider of choice;
1. Automatically receive the wrapped NFT on the destination chain;

## Technical Side

You don't have to modify your NFT Collection contract to make it work! Rarimo supports ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens, as well as NEAR NFTs and Solana Metaplex NFTs.

Algorithm for cross-chain minting:

1. `mint` the NFT to an intermediary address on the source chain;
1. `approve` NFT spending for the Rarimo Bridge Contract;
1. Call `depositERC721`(or another deposit method) on the Rarimo Bridge Contract;

The entire process should be encapsulated in a wrapper contract. It will reduce the number of transactions a User has to sign and save money on fees.

Let's examine how the protocol works on a simple example: a Polygon User wants to mint an NFT and redeem it on Ethereum Mainnet:

The Protocol uses threshold signatures(TSS) to keep the gas costs lower than in traditional multi-sig bridges.

Relayer service is optional and handles the automatic unlocking of assets on the destination chain. Alternatively, the unlock transaction may be submitted by the User or your backend.
