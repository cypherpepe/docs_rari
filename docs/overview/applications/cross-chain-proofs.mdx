# Rarimo Cross Chain Proofs

Rarimo allows you to transfer proof of owning identity, credential, or certificate from one chain to another. Note that you should contact our team to register your specific NFT or SBT contracts before you can use these contracts.

## Based on ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens

In case token is represented as a transferable NFT, you have to lock it in the Rarimo bridge smart contract to transfer proofs of owning it from one chain to another.

1. Approve bridge smart contract to transfer NFT using `setApprovalForAll` method from [ERC721](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L136) or [ERC1155](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L100) standard. It should be done only the first time for each NFT contract.
2. Call the deposit method on the bridge contract. For ERC721 [`depositERC721`](https://rarimo.gitlab.io/docs/docs/smart-contracts/interface/evm-reference#depositerc721), for ERC1155 [`depositERC1155`](https://rarimo.gitlab.io/docs/docs/smart-contracts/interface/evm-reference#depositerc1155). Note that you could specify some code that should be called on destination chain using [bundling feature](https://rarimo.gitlab.io/docs/docs/overview/bundling).
3. After the transaction is confirmed, usually 10-20 blocks are needed, Rarimo relayers will mint token on the destination network.

## Soulbound Tokens

SBT is non-transferable, so they could not lock them on to mint proof. In this case, you need proof that some address owns it to mint proof on the destination chain.
