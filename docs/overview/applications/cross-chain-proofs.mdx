# Cross-chain proofs

Rarimo enables cross-chain ownership proofs for non-fungible tokens. You can claim your identity, credentials, and certificates on any supported chain.

> **_NOTE: You should contact our team to register your specific tokens in Rarimo Protocol. _**

## NFTs

For transferrable tokens, you have to lock them in the Rarimo bridge smart contract.

1. Approve bridge smart contract to transfer NFT using `setApprovalForAll` method from [ERC721](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L136) or [ERC1155](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol#L100) standard. It should be done only the first time for each NFT contract.
1. Call the deposit method on the bridge contract. For ERC721 [`depositERC721`](https://rarimo.gitlab.io/docs/docs/smart-contracts/interface/evm-reference#depositerc721), for ERC1155 [`depositERC1155`](https://rarimo.gitlab.io/docs/docs/smart-contracts/interface/evm-reference#depositerc1155). Note that you could specify some code that should be called on destination chain using [bundling feature](https://rarimo.gitlab.io/docs/docs/overview/bundling).
1. Once the transaction is processed, Rarimo relayers will automatically mint a wrapped NFT on the destination network.

## Soulbound Tokens

> **_NOTE: Coming soon _**

SBTs are non-transferable, so they can't be locked. Thus the bridge needs to verify the sender's ownership of the token.

1. Call the `mintSBT` method on the bridge contract. It checks the SBT ownership and triggers the corresponding event in the Rarimo Core.
1. Once the transaction is processed, Rarimo relayers will automatically mint an SBT ownership token on the destination network.
