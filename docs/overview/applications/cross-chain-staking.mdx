# ERC-20 Cross-Chain Staking

Rarimo enables seamless cross-chain staking of fungible tokens. A user only sends a single transaction to lock the deposit, and we take care of bridging the assets to the target chain and staking them.


## User Flow

1. Select the destination chain and receiver address in the;
1. Approve the transaction in the wallet provider of choice;
1. The tokens get automatically staked on the destination chain;

## Technical Side

Algorithm for cross-chain staking:

1. `approve` token spending for the Rarimo Bridge Contract;
1. Call the `depositERC20` method on the Rarimo Bridge Contract. Include staking method call into a bundled transaction;

The entire process should be encapsulated in a wrapper contract. It will reduce the number of transactions a User has to sign and save money on fees.

Let's examine how the protocol works on a simple example: a User has an ERC-20 token on Mainnet Ethereum and wants to stake them into a liquidity pool on Polygon:
