# Fees

There is a fee associated with each request that is sent to the Rarimo protocol.
This fee is used to cover destination chain gas fees and fund our validator network.
For transferring coin, fungible tokens, and non-fungible tokens, it is a fixed **1.5%** of the transferred tokens.

:::note

The exact fees are available programmatically from our [API](../api/reference/get-nft.api.mdx).

:::

If there are additional parties involved in a callstack, higher fees may be charged.
As an example, the [Cross-chain Settlement](../solutions/nft-settlement.mdx) involves interacting with various distributed exchanges.
These exchanges may charge between 0.05% and 1%, which is added on top of Rarimo's protocol fee.
