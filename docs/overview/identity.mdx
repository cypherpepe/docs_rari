# Identity

Rarimo provides support for decentralized identity across chains.
Identity providers can publish information about users' identities to Rarimo and Rarimo syncs this identity metadata to other chains, including Ethereum, Solana, and Near.
Then, applications can verify the users' identities on these other chains.

Rarimo does this by supporting an embedded identity protocol, which allows uses to generate and verify zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).
These ZKPs provide only a cryptographically secure verification that the user meets the requirements of the verification, without revealing any of the user's personal information.

This identity protocol takes advantage of Rarimo's bridging protocol to make syncing the identity information across chains cheap and seamless.

## Roles

Identity verification involves three roles:

- **Issuers**: Issuers create identities and issue them to identity holders.
Some examples of issuers are:

   - Government authorities creating identification documents
   - Schools issuing degrees and certifications
   - Organizations creating credentials for members and their roles

   See [Issuing credentials](./issuing-credentials).

- **Identity holders**: Identity holders are end users who receive identities from issuers, store them in their wallets, and use them to send ZKPs to verifiers.

- **Verifiers**: Verifiers query identity holders via their wallets, verify that issuers are who they say they are, and validate the ZKPs that they receive.
See [Querying credentials](./querying-credentials).

This diagram shows the basic interactions in distributed identity in Rarimo via ZKPs:
