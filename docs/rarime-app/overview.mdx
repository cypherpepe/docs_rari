## Key Features

- **Biometric Document Scanner**: Easily scan your biometric documents using your phone's camera or NFC. This ensures quick and accurate identity verification, saving you time during sign-ups.
- **Private Data Vault**: Your identity and social connections are securely stored right on your device. We never share your data with anyone else, giving you complete control over your personal information.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Share specific parts of your identity without revealing all your personal information. For example, prove you're over 18 without showing your exact birthdate. You can present these proofs through QR codes when using social apps.
- **Rewards Program**: Earn rewards for signing up, inviting friends, and completing various tasks within the app. Enjoy incentives that make using RariMe even more beneficial.
