# Abstract

There are a large number of platforms that support smart contracts for a variety of use cases; Developers can choose the optimal dApps for the functioning of their solution. However, the abundance of systems has greatly fragmented the market preventing applications from accessing external ecosystems. In such conditions, it is necessary to have a protocol that covers the needs of communication between systems and allows to transfer of data and assets over existing networks.

**Rarimo** is the next-generation messaging protocol offering cross-chain data, identity, and digital asset management. Rarimo enables the free movement of assets and identities across chains allowing users and dApps a choice that was not afforded before. With Rarimo, the future of multi-chain ecosystems and the network effect between them is unlocked. There are many advantages seen in using Rarimo. The first is that Rarimo provides high-security guarantees at a constant transfer price (due to the use of TSS). The second is the ease of integrating messaging contracts with existing dApps. This saves users and developers of the application on top of the bridge to understand the technical features of the systems between which such a transfer is made. The third advantage is that the architecture of the protocol allows the implementation of streamlined user flows: one action = result. The user can interact with decentralized applications directly through the messaging protocol using the token of their choice and send only one transaction to the parent network. This feature opens up many use cases such as single transaction cross-chain checkout, cross-chain lending, and staking through a single transaction.
