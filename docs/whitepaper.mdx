# Abstract

Identity isn’t only about your physical or digital passport. Identity isn’t only about a single NFT issued on Ethereum
that provides proof of your humanity. It’s not only about dozens of non-transferrable cryptographic badges and your
social graphs built by different protocols. Identity isn’t only about what DeFi protocols know about you (credit
history, reputation, financial portfolio, etc.).

*Identity includes all mentioned aspects but doesn’t limit by them.*

The problem is all these entities can exist in different environments (where they were issued or recorded). It's
extremely difficult to provide part of your identity (with integrity and authenticity proof) to the destination system
or protocol if they exist in another environment. The easiest example we can provide for highlighting this problem:

> **A**: 	Imagine you must prove ownership of NFT allocated on Ethereum to dApp allocated on Polygon

> **B**: 	Ok, no problem, we can use the NFT bridge for it

> **A**: 	Imagine you don’t want to move this NFT and create replicas on other blockchains (because you have a  unique
thing). Or you can’t do it physically if we are talking about SBT tokens

> **B**: 	Hm, that’s more complex

> **A**: 	Fine, and finally, you must prove the state of your account in some decentralized social network, your history
of loans from a digital bank protocol, or proof of the non-existence of your profile in the blacklist registry. And all
of this together.

> **B**: 	Emmm, got it…

Another point is approaches that are used for implementing digital identity. Different projects can create different
infrastructures for the digital identities of their consumers:
- Non-fungible tokens (Lens, layer3)
- Soul-bound tokens (some POAPs or digital certificates)
- Self-sovereign identities (Iden3)
- Wallets and accounts (financial history)
- Namespaces (ENS, Unstoppable domains)
- Combinations of all mentioned

So we need something that can operate: 1 - multichain; 2 - approach agnostically (able to operate not only with tokens
but also with states and statements in a different form).

Rarimo is the next-generation messaging protocol offering cross-chain data, identity, and digital asset management.
Rarimo enables the free movement of assets and identities’ states across chains allowing users and dApps a choice that
was not afforded before. With Rarimo, the future of multi-chain ecosystems and the network effect between them is
unlocked. There are many advantages seen in using Rarimo. The first is that Rarimo provides high-security guarantees at
a constant operation price (due to the use of TSS).

The second is the ease of integrating messaging contracts with existing dApps. This saves users and developers of the
application on top of the protocol from understanding the technical features of the systems between which such an
interaction is made. The third advantage is that the architecture of the protocol allows the implementation of
streamlined user flows: one action = result. The user can interact with decentralized applications directly through the
messaging protocol. This feature opens up many use cases, such as single transaction cross-chain settlement, multichain
social posting, multichain membership proofs, etc.
