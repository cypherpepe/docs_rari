# Abstract

Many forces shape our identities; the communities we belong to, the activities we participate in, and the assets we own. Web3 identities are no different. A user 
may hold identity artifacts such as an NFT that confers DAO membership, a Soul-Bound Token (SBT) that certifies their university degree, and cryptographic proof 
that confirms their affiliations in some social graph.

Unlike in real life, however, web3 identities are not yet cohesive. This is because the web3 ecosystem is dispersed across multiple blockchains. A userâ€™s DAO NFT, 
for instance, may be issued on Ethereum, their University Credential on Solana, and their social graph may be off-chain but reflecting interactions on a dApp on 
Polygon. While a range of protocols brings interoperability to digital assets, none provide unique solutions to make digital identities and their myriad 
components interoperable. 

Firstly, the various artifacts that compose digital identities all require bespoke solutions, and yet, it is also vital that they can be used interchangeably and 
that the solutions meet certain standardizations. Secondly, identity providers generate credentials for their users. Age and residency, for instance, are two of 
the most common. However, privacy concerns require users to reveal only specific aspects of their identity, like confirming residency without sharing their 
precise address.

Rarimo is the only interoperability protocol that overcomes these challenges. It offers cross-chain identity, state, and digital asset management across chains 
using embedded ZK proofs that ensure privacy. With the ability to mint and store credentials directly on the Rarimo chain, it enables cross-chain interaction and 
integration of identity and social components across multiple networks.

**Rarimo**: As well as its identity-specific features, Rarimo has a range of characteristics that make it particularly secure, seamless, and cost-effective as a 
general-use interoperability protocol. Firstly, using a Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS), Rarimo provides high-security guarantees at a constant operation price. 
Secondly, its application layer means developers can effortlessly integrate messaging contracts from existing dApps without having to build notable amounts of 
custom, use-case-specific logic. Thirdly, Rarimo supports streamlined, single-click, single-transaction flows. This means users can perform complex, multi-chain 
activities, such as posting on dApps on multiple blockchains, with only a single click.
