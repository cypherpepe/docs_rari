# Use cases

Here are some of the primary use cases for the ZK Passport technology.

## Geolocking

## Charity airdrops

## Age verification

## Proof of personhood



DApp developers can use the passport-derived profiles to:
- Restrict access for risky countries
- Set minimum age requirements
- Create provable social graph attestations
- Prevent Sybil attacks
- Verify personhood
- Any other use cases with selective disclosure of the passport data.
