# Accounts

Rarimo is a self-sovereign protocol, meaning the user fully owns and controls her identity. To create an account, the user generates and stores a Baby Jubjub keypair `(sk, PK)` locally on the device. The keypair manages the user's identity and authenticates the public records of associations between the account, credentials, external documents, and social graph artifacts. It is also used to derive the hierarchical randomness(so-called "salt") necessary for cryptographic commitments.
