# Solana Bridge Program

The smart contract for interacting with the Rarimo protocol over Solana is similar to the NEAR blockchain.
You can view our contracts directly on `npm` and `github`.
This page serves as a reference to the interface and a summary of the capabilities.

## General Notes

## deposit_native

### Interface

```rust
pub fn deposit_native(
    program_id: Pubkey,
    bridge_admin: Pubkey,
    owner: Pubkey,
    seeds: [u8; 32],
    network_to: String,
    amount: u64,
    receiver_address: String,
    bundle_data: Option<Vec<u8>>,
    bundle_seed: Option<[u8; 32]>,
)

```

### Parameters

- `amount` how much native SOL to transfer
- `network_to` destination network
- `receiver_address` receiever address in destination chain
- `seeds` ???
- `bundle_data` encoded transaction bundle
- `bundle_seed` seed for decoding bundle and determine the addresses

The `deposit_native` method is called to transfer native coin from the Solana blockchain to a destination chain.

### Example

Here's an example call in Javascript that could transfer 5 SOL from Solana Devnet to GÃ¶rli (where it could be withdrawn as Wrapped SOL ERC20).

```javascript
const seed = ""; // TODO what should this be

const transaction = new Transaction().add(
  SystemProgram.createAccountWithSeed({
    fromPubkey: payer.publicKey,
    basePubKey: payer.publicKey,
    seed: seed,
    newAccountPubkey: pubkey,
    lamports: lamports,
    space: seed.length(), // TODO verify this
    programId: "", // TODO get Solana test contract id
  });
);

await sendAndConfirmTransaction(
  connection,
  transaction,
  [payer],
);
```
