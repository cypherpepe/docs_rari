# NEAR Contract Reference

Rarimo's smart contract interface on the NEAR blockchain is similar, but not identical, to the EVM smart contracts.
You can pull our NEAR contract via `npm` and `github`.
This page is a quick reference for the interface and capabilities of this contract.

## General Notes

### Emitted Events

Each of these methods will emit an event in a standardized way.
As an example, the `native_deposit` will emit an event of `native_deposited` when it is called.
All of the parameters passed in will be part of the emitted event, in the same order.

## native_deposit

### Interface

```rust
#[payable]
pub fn native_deposit(
  &mut self,
  receiver_id: AccountId,
  chain: String,
  bundle_data: Option<String>,
  bundle_hash: Option<String>,
)
```

### Parameters

- `receiver_id` receiver address in destination chain
- `chain` network name destination of the transfer
- `bundle_data` endcoded transaction bundle
- `bundle_hash` hash for decoding bundle and determine the addresses

The `native_deposit` method is called to transfer native coin from the NEAR blockchain to a destination chain.
You will need to pass in the amount of native coin in the signature, usually via a wallet, that you want to transfer.

### Example

Here's an example call in Javascript that could transfer 100 NEAR from NEAR testnet to Ethereum (where it could be withdrawn as Wrapped NEAR ERC20).

```javascript
await wallet.callMethod({
  contractId: '0x',
  method: 'deposit_native',
  args: {
    receiver_id: '0x',
    chain: 'goerli',
    bundle_data: '0x',
    bundle_hash: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001',
  },
  50000,
  100,
});
```
