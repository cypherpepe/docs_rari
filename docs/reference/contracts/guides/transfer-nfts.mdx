# Transfer NFTs Between Chains

Rarimo's bridging protocol allows you to transfer NFTs between the supported blockchains.
There are two ways to do this, and you can switch between the two with the `wrapped` parameter.

1. `wrapped=true` will lock the token and unlock a similar token on the destination chain
1. `wrapped=false` will burn the token and mint a new token on the destination chain

Either method will preserve the original token information for later reference.

:::note

To check to make sure the token can be transferred, you can use our [API](../../../api/reference/get-token-list.api.mdx).

:::

## Example

As an example, let's say that you want to transfer an ERC721 NFT from Avalanche to Ethereum.
You want to burn the token on Avalance and mint a new one on Ethereum, and have it dropped in your Ethereum wallet.

### Setup Configuration Parameters

> May be useful to have a note in here about dotenv

```
RPC_PROVIDER // preferred RPC provider, such as alchemy or infura
PRIVATE_KEY // your wallet private key... Be Careful!
RARIMO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS // source chain contract address
NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS // contract address on source chain for NFT
NFT_ID // the id of your NFT within the contract
WALLET_ADDRESS // your wallet address, on destination chain
```

### Send NFT to Avalanche Contract

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

// broken up for readability, this is totally optional
const contractInterface = [
  "function depositERC721(" +
    "address token_, " +
    "uint256 tokenId_, " +
    "tuple(bytes32 salt, bytes bundle) bundle_, " +
    "string network_, " +
    "string receiver_, " +
    "boolean isWrapped_" +
  ")"
];

const ethereumProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
  process.env.RPC_PROVIDER,
);

const signer = new ethers.Wallet(
  process.env.PRIVATE_KEY,
  ethereumProvider,
);

const rarimoContract = new ethers.Contract(
  process.env.RARIMO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  contractInterface,
  signer,
);

// mock bundle - this won't actually do anything
const stubBundle = {
  salt: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
  bundle: "0x",
};

async function main() {
  const transaction = await rarimoContract.depositERC721(
    process.env.NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    process.env.NFT_ID,
    stubBundle,
    "ethereum",
    process.env.WALLET_ADDRESS,
    false,
  );

  const output = await transaction.wait();
  return output.transactionHash;
}

(async () => await main().then(console.log)();
```

### Unlock Transaction on Destination
