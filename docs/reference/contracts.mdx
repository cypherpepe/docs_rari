# Smart contracts

Rarimo smart contracts are the primary way to interact with our multi-chain protocol.
Developers can send data, assets, or liquidity; build cross-chain integrations; or retrieve protocol information using these contracts.
Whenever possible, the contracts use similar interfaces and signatures to make integrating cross-chain easy.
