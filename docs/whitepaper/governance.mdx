# Governance

The Rarimo smart contracts prescribe the initial governance structure.
Thereafter, the DAO can change the governance model.

## Initial governance model

Initially, anyone who holds RMO tokens can participate in governance.
To propose changes, the creator deposits 100 RMO tokens along with submitting the proposal.

Then, Rarimo users have 2 weeks to vote.
They can vote to accept the proposal, reject it, or flag it as fraudulent.

If a simple majority of the voters votes to accept and a quorum is reached, the proposal is accepted and the protocol will be updated.
The creator receives a reward determined by the protocol.

If not enough voters vote to accept, the proposal is rejected and the deposited tokens are returned to the proposer.
If the voters vote that the proposal is fraudulent, the proposer's tokens are burned.

## Future governance model

In the future, the governance structure might have these features:

1. On-chain governance in which any RMO holder can participate

2. Off-chain ministerial structure created by the DAO, whose sole function is to implement decisions of the on-chain governance

## Proposal process

The proposal process requires proposers to submit a proposal and also block RMO tokens as a deposit to ensure good faith.
Then users that stake tokens can vote on the proposal.

For a proposal to be accepted, the submitted votes must achieve a quorum.
A quorum is 50% of the amount of staked RMO tokens at the moment that voting ends, plus one token.
A user's voting power is the number of their staked tokens, and the total voting power is the number of all staked tokens at the end of the voting period.

1. Preparation

   1. The proposer suggests the idea and discusses it online, such as on the [Rarimo discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/rarimoprotocol).

   1. The proposer writes a draft of the proposal, including this information:

      - Problem and motivation
      - Proposed solution
      - Risks and benefits, including the beneficiaries and the importance of the change
      - Supplementary materials
      - If the proposal requires a grant from the community, the funding details, deliverables, timeline, and responsibilities

   1. The proposer sends a draft of the proposal to the community and discusses it with community members

   1. The proposer submits the proposal to testnet and tests it

   1. If the proposer thinks that the majority of the community will support the proposal, they submit it to the mainnet

1. Deposit

   To submit a proposal, the proposer must block at least 100 RMO tokens to ensure that they are making the proposal in good faith.
   The proposer receives this deposit back unless users vote that the proposal is fraudulent, spam, or otherwise inappropriate, in which case the tokens are burnt.

   If the proposer does not block enough tokens, other users can block tokens in support of the proposal.
   The proposal must have 100 tokens deposited within 7 days of submission.

1. Voting

   When the proposal is received, a 14-day voting period begins.
   During the voting period, participants may make one of the following votes by sending a transaction for the appropriate option on the mainchain.
   They can send a new transaction to change their vote before the voting period ends.

   These are the valid vote options:

   - Abstain: The voter does not express an opinion for or against the proposal but adds their vote to help achieve a quorum
   - Yes: The voter supports the proposal
   - No: The voter does not support the proposal
   - NoWithVeto: The voter does not support the proposal and flags it as fraudulent, spam, or otherwise inappropriate

1. Result

   - If all of the following criteria are met, the proposal is accepted:

     - The sum of the tokens voted Yes add up to 50% of the voting power plus one vote are Yes at the end of the voting period
     - The proposal has enough deposited tokens within 7 days of submission
     - Less than 34% of the tokens voted are NoWithVeto
     - A quorum is reached

     If any of these criteria are not met, the proposal fails.
     In this case, if less than 34% of the votes are NoWithVeto, the tokens are returned.

   - If 34% or more of the voters vote NoWithVeto, the proposal is rejected and the tokens are burnt, regardless of the other votes.
