# Utilities of the Token
## Fees
Payment of fees inside the Rarimo protocol - main utility function of the Token. The exact types of fees and their
structure will be set by the DAO. It is suggested, as for now, that Rarimo protocol may have the following 2 types of fees:

1. fee that should be paid in RMO Token. This fee covers operations with transferring  Tokens and messages over the connected networks
2. fees that can be paid in the platform-supported assets. This kind of fee covers transfers of ERC20 tokens through the bridge

## Governance
As described below, Tokens will be used as a tool of governance for the DAO.

## Selecting validators of the Rarimo core
The token is also designed for achieving bridge security. There is a minimum RMO set by the smart contract to send the
transaction for being a validator. As soon as a node has a set amount of staked RMO, other Token holders can stake some
amount of their Tokens for this node. The nodes for which the most Tokens were staked become the guarantors of the
protocol. In this way, you can get a truly democratic choice of protocol validators. The described rules may be changed by the DAO.

If the verifier did some violation - any user can report that (on-chain transaction). If other users approved the fact
of the violation (via voting procedure) - the stake of the validator transfers to the community pool. By default, there
are only 2 types of violations that presume a 100% stake validator penalty - the signing of 2 or more blocks of the same
height and an attempt to add conflicting transactions within one block.
