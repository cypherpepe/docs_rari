# Light wallets supporting
This approach saves users from completely synchronizing history with Rarimo core. To work with the system, users and
auditors can use a light wallet. Thus, it stores only the block headers (and evidence), but at the same time, the user
has the ability to quickly check and prove the status of each necessary transaction. That is, a light client can request
a witness from any full node and check that it was actually generated for the desired transaction and can be used for
receiving the message from the Rarimo Contract.
