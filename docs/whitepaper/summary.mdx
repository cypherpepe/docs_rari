# Summary
The multichain ecosystem is rapidly expanding. To realize its full potential, there must be a way to communicate across
chains quickly, safely, and in a cost-effective way. Rarimo is the next-generation messaging protocol that does so with
critical benefits.

First, TSS provides high-security guarantees at a constant transfer price. The second is the ease of integrating
messaging contracts with existing dApps without much custom development effort. The third advantage is that the
protocol's architecture allows the implementation of streamlined user flows: one action equals the result. The user can
interact with dApps directly through the messaging protocol using the token of their choice and send only one
transaction to the parent network.

With network effects being facilitated through this novel infrastructure, the ecosystem can fully harness innovative
on-chain uses beyond value transfer, including the communication of identity, provenance, reputation, and virtual
assets proofs across the entire web3 universe.
