# Problem Statement

Most current multi-chain solutions focus on cases where token transfers (bridging) suffice. Only a handful of these solutions are suitable for transferring 
different types of data, including cross-chain calls, but even then, they are only able to act as postmen for this data and cannot provide an additional layer of 
optimization and aggregation.

*Imagine asking a registry if it has a particular entry and, instead of receiving confirmation, being returned to the archive and told to figure it out on your 
own. This is how most messaging protocols operate. They move data and guarantee its authenticity, but the usefulness and effectiveness of this approach are 
questionable.*

Furthermore, most solutions for cross-chain transfers of tokens or data use a similar security model - **multi-signature** and a **predefined set of trusted oracles**. 
This model is notoriously vulnerable to hacks and has led to millions of dollars of losses [2-4], but safe alternatives are few and far between as increasing 
security typically drives architectural complexity and user fees to unsustainable levels. 

So, for now, the focus of innovation in the multichain messaging space is on:
- **Flexibility** and adaptiveness for different cases
- **Cost** of the action
- **Interoperability** (how fast new networks and tokens can be added to the protocol)
- **Speed** of actions using the protocol
- **Security** and Assurance of interaction
