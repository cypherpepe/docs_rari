# Problem Statement

Almost all solutions for moving tokens or data across chains use a similar security model - multisignature and trusted oracles. It often leads to hacks and losing millions of dollars [2-4]. On the other hand, the complexity of the architecture and the increase in the level of security of the bridge clearly lead to an increase in the fees required to make transfer tokens or messages over networks.

So for now the focus of innovation in the bridging space is on: 
- Cost of bridging (all fees that should be paid for transferring assets)
- Interoperability (how fast new networks and tokens can be added to the bridge)
- Speed of transfer within the bridge
- Security and Assurance in bridging
