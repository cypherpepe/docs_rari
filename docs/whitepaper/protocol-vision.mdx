# Rarimo Protocol Vision

In this document, the features and technical details of Rarimo will be shown. The primary goal of which	 is to ensure a
high level of decentralization (dozens of validators) in the cross-chain transfers area and achieve a level of cost
efficiency compared with existing decentralized solutions.

Rarimo will be created as a cross-chain messaging protocol with a set of sub-protocols built on top. Such architecture
will make the protocol more flexible and adapted for different use cases. As a base layer, a low-level cross-chain messaging
protocol is used. On top of this messaging protocol, there is a bridging protocol that adds the functionality of securely
locking/unlocking assets and has enough flexibility to build applications on top of this bridging logic. The third level
will be applications that use the bridging protocol for different use cases.

Security of Rarimo protocol will be handled by two main roles: Validators and Signers. Validators will be responsible for two main actions:
* Security of Rarimo blockchain
* Being Oracle that submits and checks events on connected chains

Signers will be responsible for producing a threshold signature based on the actions submitted to Rarimo blockchain that
could be used in connected chains as proof of checking event in an external network.

The messaging protocol architecture of Rarimo can support the following verticals:

## Liquidity (Marketplaces, Defi & Lending)
* Streamlined cross-chain NFT purchases with any ERC20
* Proof of Digital Asset Ownership and Reputation for Lending
* Fractionalization
* Optimized NFT pooling and staking
* Bulk migration of NFTs from dying chains to thriving ones

## Compatibility (Metaverses, Gaming)
* Quickly scale assets across chains for different metaverses
* Cross-chain NFT drops
* Brand asset migration by end users
* L1 <-> L2 asset swaps

## Access (Identity & Reputation, DAO)
* Proof of Identity across chains
* Extension of voting rights in DAO based on holdings
* Community-enabled key recovery permissions
