# Rarimo Protocol Vision

In this document, the features and technical details of Rarimo will be shown. The primary goal of which	 is to ensure a
high level of decentralization (dozens of validators) in the cross-chain transfers area and achieve a level of cost
efficiency compared with existing decentralized solutions.

Rarimo will be created as a cross-chain messaging protocol with a set of sub-protocols built on top. Such architecture
will make the protocol more flexible and adapted for different use cases. As a base layer, a low-level cross-chain messaging
protocol is used. On top of this messaging protocol, there is a bridging protocol that adds the functionality of securely
locking/unlocking assets and has enough flexibility to build applications on top of this bridging logic. The third level
will be applications that use the bridging protocol for different use cases.
