# Protocol Design

We believe in a multichain future for web3, and designed our protocol to enable this future.
This gives our protocol fundamental advantages over other cross-chain providers available today.

## Advantages

### Scalable Security

We use TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme) to provide cost-efficient security.
Our network will scale with integrations and web3 adoption, all while maintaining first-class security and fixed transfer costs.

### Easy Integrations

Existing contracts can be easily plugged into our callstack.
You don't need to waste time or resources rewriting your contracts or dApp to interact with our protocol.

### Bundling

Transactions on our protocol are bundled, so one user request will equal one transaction.
This results in low costs for multi-step flows, clean integrations, and simple fallback mechanisms.

## Sub-Protocols

Rarimo has a general messaging protocol foundation with a set of sub-protocols built on top.
We can easily adapt to emerging technologies and applications.
One of these sub-protocols can securely lock and unlock assets, which dApps directly integrate with.

## Decentralization

Our system is based on a network of independent validators and oracles.
Validators work together to achieve secure consensus on events, and oracles deliver messages over the network.
Each validator is responsible for moving events from the initial chain to the destination.

# Architecture

The Rarimo protocol architecture includes the following parts:

- Rarimo Core (Blockchain core that stores validated state)
- TSS service (Threshold signature producers that signs validated operations to provide proof for unlocking on the destination chain)
- Vault (Stores the TSS service keys)
- Saver services or Oracles (The oracles that observers the connected chains state, submits new events and vote for new events' correctness)
- Broadcaster service (Running to broadcast transactions from different services by certain account)
- Smart-contracts (Bridges)
- BDJuno, Hasura and Explorer frontend
- Horizon (Service that communicates with core and provides REST API for frontend integration)
- Relayer service and contracts (Provides user with opportunity to pay for automatic transaction execution)
