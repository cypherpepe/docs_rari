# Smart Contracts

Rarimo's smart contracts are the primary way to interface with our multichain protocol.
Developers can send data, assets, or liquidity; build cross-chain integrations; or retrieve protocol information using these contracts.
Whenever possible, we made sure to maintain similar interface and signatures to make integrating cross-chain easy.

## Interface

> TODO: Link to the raw code of our contracts... probably in Github

## Addresses

We have all of our contract addresses available on the [Contract Addresses page](smart-contracts/addresses.mdx) and through our [API](api/reference/get-chain-list.api.mdx).
