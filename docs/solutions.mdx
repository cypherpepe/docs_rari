# Solutions

Our smart contracts and API can be leveraged to build a wide array of future-facing integrations on top of Rarimo's protocols.
To help illustrate this, we have already built a functional React component that can be used, with minimal configuration, by an NFT Marketplace to allow cross-chain purchases.
Beyond this, we plan on building more functional demos, and can work with your team to build specialized solutions.
