# Getting started

The easiest way to get started with the protocol is to create a simple React application that can access users' wallets.

You can use the applications in [rarimo/js-sdk-examples](https://github.com/rarimo/js-sdk-examples) or follow these steps to set up your own application locally:

1. Make sure that Node.JS, NPX, and Yarn are installed.

1. Install one of these wallets in your web browser if you don't have one already:

   - Coinbase
   - Metamask
   - NEAR
   - Phantom
   - Solflare

1. In your terminal, create a starter create-react-app application by running this command:

   ```shell
   npx create-react-app my-rarimo-app --template typescript
   ```

1. Run `cd my-rarimo-app` to go into the application folder.

1. Run this command to install the React-related packages of the Rarimo SDK:

   ```shell
   yarn add @rarimo/provider @rarimo/react-provider
   ```

1. Run this command to install the `craco` package as a development dependency:

   ```shell
   yarn add -D @craco/craco
   ```

1. In the root of the folder, where the `package.json` file is, create a file named `craco.config.js` add this code to it:

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     webpack: {
       configure: {
         module: {
           rules: [
             {
               test: /\.m?js$/,
               resolve: {
                 fullySpecified: false,
               },
             },
           ],
         },
       },
     },
   }
   ```

1. In the `package.json` file, change the start, build, and test commands to use `craco`, as in this example:

   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "start": "craco start",
       "build": "craco build",
       "test": "craco test"
     }
   }
   ```

1. Replace the contents of the automatically-generated file `src/App.tsx` with this code:

   ```tsx
   import { MetamaskProvider } from '@rarimo/provider'
   import { useProvider } from '@rarimo/react-provider'

   function App() {
     const { provider } = useProvider(MetamaskProvider)

     provider?.connect()
     console.log(provider?.address)

     return <div className="App">Wallet address: {provider?.address}</div>
   }

   export default App
   ```

1. In the `src/App.tsx` file, set the type of wallet that you want to use by changing the `MetamaskProvider` provider type to one of these provider types:

   - [`CoinbaseProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_provider.CoinbaseProvider.html): Coinbase wallets
   - [`MetamaskProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_provider.MetamaskProvider.html): Metamask wallets
   - [`NearProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_provider.NearProvider.html): NEAR wallets
   - [`PhantomProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_provider.PhantomProvider.html): Phantom wallets
   - [`SolflareProvider`](https://rarimo.github.io/js-sdk/classes/_rarimo_provider.SolflareProvider.html): Solflare wallets

1. In the terminal, run `yarn start` and wait for the application to start.
The application opens automatically in your default web browser, or you can open the page in a web browser by going to the URL `http://localhost:3000`.

1. When the application prompts you to connect your wallet, log in to your wallet and allow the connection.

If the application is working correctly, it prints the address of your wallet on the page, as in this picture:

From here, you can set up cross-chain integrations, such as transactions.
For an example, see [Creating NFT checkout transactions](./overview/creating-transactions).
