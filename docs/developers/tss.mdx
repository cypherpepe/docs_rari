# TSS

- Repo: [TSS](gitlab.com/rarimo/tss/tss-svc)

In the fully-decentralized version of Rarimo bridge the operations' confirmation contains the threshold signature produced by a set of parties.
The tss-svc is a party implementation that is responsible for generating/resharing TSS keys and signing operations.
