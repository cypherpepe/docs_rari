# Oracles (Savers)

The saver services designed to be launched by validators in two supported modes:
- saver (connects to the chain rpc and submits new transfer operations to the Rarimo core)
- voter (fetches new operations from core, verifies the content and votes for its correctness)

Currently there are three implementations exists:
- evm-saver (used with any evm-compatible chains)
- solana-saver (used with any solana-compatible chains)
- near-saver (used with any near-compatible chains)

Every validator should run validator node (rarimo-core) and voter mode for every supported chain. Saver mode can be optionally runned.
