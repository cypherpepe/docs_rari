# RariMe

RariMe is a self-sovereign wallet that lives in your MetaMask. It allows users to store, manage, and disclose credentials in a privacy-preserving way.

Key features:
- Supports W3C DID Verifiable Credentials
- Familiar Web3 UX in your web browser
- Integrated with your MetaMask account, no additional passwords or private keys are needed
- Secure, selective disclosure of personal data using zero-knowledge proofs

<!-- TODO: add video demo -->

## RariMe Snap

[RariMe Snap](https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/rarimo/rarime/) is an extension for MetaMask. DApps can interact with the snap via the [JS library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rarimo/rarime-connector) to issue Rarimo credentials or request zero-knowledge proofs for user identity verification.
