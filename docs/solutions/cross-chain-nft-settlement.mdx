# Cross-Chain NFT Settlement

To illustrate the capabilities of our protocol, we have built a functional, drop-in React component that allows cross-chain purchases of NFTs.
This component is designed to be plugged directly into any NFT marketplace on our supported blockchains.

## Key Features

### Simple Configuration

You can import and customize the component to fit your branding and messaging.
There are a few necessary configuration parameters to make sure that it works correctly, which are documented on our [configuration reference](cross-chain-nft-settlement/configuration.mdx).

### Fungible Token Support

We leverage the most trusted decentralized exchanges across the web3 ecosystem for liquidity.
Any trusted token with enough liquidity can be used to settle a cross-chain NFT purchase.
To see which exchanges we've hooked into, see our [liquidity exchanges](cross-chain-nft-settlement/exchanges.mdx).

### User Flow

Our component has a very explicit user journey to make the purchaser aware, and feel confident, in their purchase.
