# Glossary

**Bridge contract**

Bridge contracts are a group of smart contracts that are deployed to different chains that enable you to transfer value from one chain to another
The user submits a deposit transaction to the bridge contract on the source chain and the bridge contract on the target chain withdraws tokens on the target chain.
See [Bridge overview](./reference/contracts/bridge).

**Bundling**

Bundling is the process of combining multiple transactions into a single transaction.
See [Bundling](./overview/bundling).

**Decentralized application (dApp)**

A dApp is an application made of one or more smart contracts running on a blockchain and a user interface.

**Decentralized exchange (DEX)**

A service that exchanges one token for another on the same chain, like a currency exchange.

**Decentralized identifier (DID)**

A DID is a unique identifier that is registered with a distributed or decentralized network.

**Delegated proof of stake**

Delegated proof of stake is a way of using consensus to select validators.
Users propose themselves as validators and other users that trust them stake tokens on their behalf.
Users with the most staked tokens become validators for a certain length of time.

**Digital autonomous organization (DAO)**

A DAO is a member-owned community without centralized leadership or governing bodies.
Rarimo uses a DAO to manage its threshold signature scheme.

**Distributed key generation (DKG)**

DKG is a method for creating a key by combining secrets from multiple parties.
As a result, no individual party can construct the key without secrets from the other parties.

**Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)**

ECDSA is a complex public key cryptography signature algorithm in which keys are generated via elliptic curve cryptography.

**Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)**

EdDSA is a complex public key cryptography signature algorithm that is based on Edwards curves.

**Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**

A computation engine that is the foundation for EVM-compatible blockchains such as Ethereum and Polygon.
See [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org).

**Merkle tree**

A Merkle tree stores hashes of data in a tree that allows you to verify the contents of the tree.
You can use Merkle branches to follow the hashes through the tree to verify that a specific piece of data is in the tree.

**Non-fungible token (NFT)**

An NFT is a piece of data stored on a blockchain that certifies a digital asset to be unique and not interchangeable with any other asset.
NFTs are different from fungible tokens such as BTC and ETH because fungible tokens are equivalent and interchangeable.

**Oracle**

In general blockchain terms, Oracles provide information from outside a blockchain to smart contracts on the blockchain.
Rarimo oracles observe blockchains for events, deliver these events to the Rarimo core, and verify events from other oracles.
See [Oracles](./architecture/oracles).

**Provider**

A provider is an object that represents a user's wallet so you can interact with it in your code.
See [Connecting to wallets](./overview/connecting-to-wallets).

**Rarimo**

Rarimo is a protocol for messaging data and bridging assets between different blockchain-based systems.
Rarimo consists primarily of smart contracts, services, and oracles that automate these tasks.

**Relayer**

The Rarimo relayer service helps automate cross-chain operations.
When one bridge contract locks tokens, it generates a witness to prove that it has the tokens.
The relayer sees that witness and sends a transaction to another bridge contract to unlock tokens on another chain.

**RMO**

RMO is the Rarimo token.
The RMO token is used for governance of the Rarimo project, among other things.
Users can stake RMO tokens to become oracles.
See [Governance](./whitepaper/governance).

**Secp256k1**

Secp256k1 refers to the parameters used in cryptography algorithms such as ECDSA.
See [Secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1).

**Smart contract**

Smart contracts are programs that run on EVM-compatible blockchains.
They can provide public functions and accept transactions, such as selling NFTs or exchanging tokens.
Smart contracts provide the logic for NFTs and decentralized applications.

**Soulbound token (SBT)**

Soulbound tokens are tokens that cannot be transferred.
They often represent parts of a user's identity, history, or accomplishments.

**Swap contract**

Swap contracts are smart contracts that exchange one token for another token on the same chain via a decentralized exchange (DEX).

**Threshold signature scheme (TSS)**

TSS is a cryptographic method to produce a single signature from a pool of parties, none of which have access to all of the key to create the signature by themselves.
This process uses distributed key generation (DKG) to generate the key.
See [TSS](./architecture/tss).

**Validator**

Validators are nodes that verify that transactions are valid before adding them to the blockchain.

**Verifiable credential (VC)**

VCs represent claims such as proof of ownership of an account.
They include a proof that allows users to verify that the credential is authentic.
