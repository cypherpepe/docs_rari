# Moving Liquidity Across Chains

Moving liquidity, either with ERC20 tokens or native coins, is easy with Rarimo's protocol.
It is important to understand how the liquidity will transfer.

1. If the token exists on both chains, then the transfer will be symmetric. USDC tokens on Polygon will unlock USDC on Binance.
1. Native coins rarely on multiple chains and will be mapped to wrapped versions. Ether on Ethereum will unlock Wrapped Ether on Solana.

## Token Pair Examples

> We should link the exact ERC20 token version once it is defined

| Ethereum | Polygon | Avalanche | Solana |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ether | WETH | WETH | WETH |
| WMATIC | Matic | WMATIC | WMATIC |
| WAVAX | WAVAX | AVAX | WAVAX |
| WSOL | WSOL | WSOL | Sol |
| USDC | USDC | USDC | USDC |

:::note

You can always get the exact pairs of tokens that Rarimo supports with our [API](api/reference/get-token-list.api.mdx).

## Example

With this difference in mind, let's look at an example transfer.
You have a friend on the Polygon network and want to send them some native Matic coin.
The only on-chain liquidity you have is on the Ethereum network.
Referencing the *outstanding* Rarimo documentation and API, you realize that you can transfer WMATIC -> Matic.

### Setup Configuration Parameters

> May be useful to have a note in here about dotenv

```
RPC_PROVIDER // preferred RPC provider, such as alchemy or infura
PRIVATE_KEY // your wallet private key... Be Careful!
RARIMO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS // source chain contract address
TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS // wrapped token contract on source chain
FRIEND_CONTRACT_ADDRESS // friend's wallet address
```

### Lock WMATIC Tokens in Ethereum Contract

> TODO: verify this works once we get functional relayers

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

const contractInterface = [
  "function depositERC20(" +
    "address token_, " +
    "uint256 amount_, " +
    "tuple(bytes32 salt, bytes bundle) bundle_, " +
    "string network_, " +
    "string receiver_, " +
    "boolean isWrapped_" +
  ")"
];

const ethereumProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
  process.env.RPC_PROVIDER,
);

const signer = new ethers.Wallet(
  process.env.PRIVATE_KEY,
  ethereumProvider,
);

const rarimoContract = new ethers.Contract(
  process.env.RARIMO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  contractInterface,
  signer,
);

async function main() {
  const transaction = await rarimoContract.depositERC20(
    process.env.TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    1,
    {
      salt: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
      bundle: "0x",
    },
    "polygon",
    process.env.FRIEND_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    true,
  );

  const output = await transaction.wait();
  return output.transactionHash;
}

(async () => await main())();
```
